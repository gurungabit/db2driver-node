# @gurungabit/db2-node

`@gurungabit/db2-node` is a pure Rust DB2 driver for Node.js. It speaks the DRDA wire protocol directly, so there is no IBM CLI, ODBC, or `libdb2` runtime dependency.

This repository contains the driver, the protocol implementation, the Node.js bindings, the docs site, and the integration test harness used to ship the npm package.

## Repository Layout

- `crates/db2-proto` — low-level DRDA protocol encoding/decoding
- `crates/db2-client` — async Rust client, pooling, transactions, TLS, prepared statements
- `crates/db2-napi` — `napi-rs` bindings published as the `@gurungabit/db2-node` npm package
- `tests/integration` — Rust integration tests against a real DB2 instance
- `tests/node` — Node.js integration tests against the public JS API
- `docs` — Hugo docs site
- `examples/demo.ts` / `examples/demo-million.ts` — repo-local examples for quick validation and benchmarking
- `examples/todo-app` — full-stack example app using the published Node bindings

## Package Quick Start

```bash
npm install @gurungabit/db2-node
```

```ts
import { Client } from "@gurungabit/db2-node";

const client = new Client({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 50000,
  database: "testdb",
  user: "db2inst1",
  password: "secret",
});

await client.connect();

const result = await client.query(
  "SELECT id, name FROM employees WHERE dept_id = ?",
  [1],
);

console.log(result.rows);

await client.close();
```

Package-level usage and API details live in `crates/db2-napi/README.md`.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Rust toolchain
- Node.js 18+
- Docker

### Start the local DB2 test instance

```bash
make db2-start
```

To stop it again:

```bash
make db2-stop
```

## Build

Build the Rust workspace:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

Build the Node native addon:

```bash
cd crates/db2-napi
npm install
npm run build
```

## Test

Rust unit / protocol tests:

```bash
cargo test -p db2-proto
```

Rust integration tests:

```bash
cargo test -p db2-integration-tests -- --nocapture
```

Rust TLS integration tests:

```bash
DB2_TEST_SSL_PORT=50001 cargo test -p db2-integration-tests --test tls_test -- --nocapture
```

Node integration tests:

```bash
cd tests/node
npm ci
npm test
```

Node TLS tests:

```bash
cd tests/node
DB2_TEST_SSL_PORT=50001 npm test
```

## Run the Demos

The demos use the same `DB2_TEST_*` environment variables as the test suite.

Quick end-to-end demo:

```bash
npx --yes tsx examples/demo.ts
```

Bulk insert/read benchmark:

```bash
DEMO_TOTAL_ROWS=100000 npx --yes tsx examples/demo-million.ts
```

## Docs Site

Build the Hugo site:

```bash
make docs-build
```

Serve it locally with live reload:

```bash
make docs-serve
```

Then open:

- `http://localhost:1313/db2-node/`

The local docs site includes search and is configured to match the GitHub Pages subpath.

## Release Flow

- The npm package is `@gurungabit/db2-node`
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` opens and updates a release PR from `main`
- Merging that release PR creates the next `v*` tag
- Tag pushes matching `v*` trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- The release workflow builds prebuilt binaries, smoke-tests module loading, and publishes npm artifacts

### Release Automation Notes

- Release Please follows Conventional Commits; `feat`, `fix`, and `deps` commits are releasable by default
- For the tag created by Release Please to trigger the publish workflow, set a `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` secret to a PAT or GitHub App token with repository write access

## Status

The local workspace is in strong release shape:

- Rust and Node integration suites are green
- TLS behavior is covered in both Rust and Node tests
- Prepared statements, pooling, reconnect behavior, and timeout handling have all been hardened
- The remaining release-risk item is validating the tag-driven publish pipeline with a real release candidate tag
